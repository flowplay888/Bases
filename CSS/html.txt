  <article>
    <p>This morning I woke up to dozens of messages from students who had read an article titled “Please Don’t Learn to Code.”</p>
    <p>At first, I assumed <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/" target=_blank> Jeff Atwood’s 2012 article</a>had spontaneously reappeared on Reddit. But no?—?this was a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code/" target="_blank"> brand new Tech Crunch article</a>of the same name, which echoed Atwood’s assertion that encouraging everyone to learn programming is like encouraging everyone to learn plumbing.</p>
    <p>Here’s why programming?—?unlike plumbing?—?is an important skill that everyone should learn: <strong>programming is how humans talk to machines.</strong></p>
